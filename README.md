# screenreader README

Screen Reader is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows the user to highlight anything from a single letter to an entire .js file and use the Command Palette to read the code aloud using Microsoft Azure's text-to-speech capabilities.

## Requirements

In order to run this code, you will need to install the following npm pacakges: 

`npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk`

`npm install speaker`

## Known Issues

I am working on being able to call up the current line from the VS Code editor.

This extension only supports .js files at this time.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Visual Code Extension for Screen Reader.
